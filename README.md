# Climbing App
=====

This is a very simple app that pretends to show my skills as a full stack developer.

In order to do that, I created a new PHP project from scratch without any framework to show patterns and my code style. Also I have included vue.js in the frontend.

In next steps, I will create this project again using Laravel.

[Live demo!!](https://climbingapp.auret.es)

## TODO's:

    1. Add logger.
    2. Implement tests.
